Alzheimer's Disease Overview:
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia and primarily impacts older adults, although it can occasionally affect younger individuals. Common symptoms include memory loss, difficulty completing familiar tasks, confusion with time and place, and misplacing items.

For caregivers, one major challenge is helping the patient track and recall where they have placed important items like keys, glasses, or medication. This app is designed to alleviate that challenge by providing an easy-to-use tracking tool tailored to the needs of Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers.

Purpose:
The app is designed to help Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers track and locate items commonly used by the patient. The goal is to reduce stress and improve quality of life by enabling patients to easily recall where they have placed their belongings or allowing caregivers to assist them efficiently.
